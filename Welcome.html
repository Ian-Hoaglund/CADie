<!--A paragraph describing the purpose of the website and how to use it-->
<p style= "align-items: center;">
CAD.io is a free online MRI viewing and AI driven diagnostic tool that aims to increase physician efficiency in developing countries <br>

According to <i><a href =https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6110188> The Application of Medical Artificial Intelligence Technology in Rural Areas of Developing Countries</a></i> some 
countries have as few as one radiologist for every 2 million people. The goal of this project is to provide these radiologists with free tools to improve their
workflow and increase the number of patient's they can treat. <br>
This project was created for my college capstone class and has become a personal project to demonstrate my abilities.
