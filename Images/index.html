<!--A paragraph describing the purpose of the website and how to use it-->
<p>
CAD.io is a free online dicom viewing tool that aims to provide simple computer aided diagnostic tools. <br>

According to <i><a href =https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6110188> The Application of Medical Artificial Intelligence Technology in Rural Areas of Developing Countries</a></i> some 
countries have as few as one radiologist for every 2 million people. The goal of this project is to provide these radiologists with free tools to improve their
workflow and increase the number of patient's they can treat. This website is also intended for radiology student to become familiar with computer aided diagnostics
and has a variety of sample dicom images to practice with. <br> Unfortunately, at the moment, the dicom viewer does not have integrated computer aided diagnostics tools however
a variety of diagnostic tools can downloaded from the github repositories linked in this website.
